        <p>We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... Lots of planets have a North. Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I! Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. Fantastic! Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.</p>

        <p>Don't you think she looks tired? It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! What? What?! WHAT?! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?</p>

        <p>Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. I am totally against bantering. No sir. Thirteen! Don't be lasagna. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon.</p>

        <p>Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! Doctor no more. 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? I don't have a future. Why is there never a big red button?</p>
